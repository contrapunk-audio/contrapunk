# Task for reviewer

[Read from: /Users/vibhavbobade/go/src/github.com/contrapunk-audio/contrapunk/plan.md, /Users/vibhavbobade/go/src/github.com/contrapunk-audio/contrapunk/progress.md]

Read-only design review. Given preset 08 requires a true fourth-species prepared suspension and current CounterpointLane Species4 only delays an attack, evaluate likely minimal patch in existing Lane. Focus on live-input causality (future melody unknown), transport phase, atomic P-S-R ownership, Hold semantics, and balanced NoteOn/Off across normal completion and reset/disable. Inspect relevant code yourself. Return blockers and a concrete smallest safe design; do not edit.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
