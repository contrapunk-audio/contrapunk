# Task for reviewer

[Read from: /Users/vibhavbobade/go/src/github.com/contrapunk-audio/contrapunk/plan.md, /Users/vibhavbobade/go/src/github.com/contrapunk-audio/contrapunk/progress.md]

Read-only guitar input UX/accessibility audit. Do not edit or stage. Inspect the current running-layout code in `GuitarInputPanel.svelte`, `SignalGraphs.svelte`, `InputPanel.svelte`, related theme tokens/global CSS, and progressive `PluginWorkspace.svelte`. User wants super-legible typography and a coherent post-Phase-10.1 guitar workflow. Evaluate hierarchy, labels, knob usefulness, error/idle/live states, setup/tuning/advanced disclosure, touch targets, keyboard/ARIA, color/contrast, and technical clutter. Respect dark retro identity and propose the smallest high-value production redesign, distinguishing now vs defer. Include concrete component-level recommendations.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: reviewed
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Implement the requested change without widening scope
- criterion-2: Return evidence sufficient for an independent acceptance review

Required evidence: changed-files, tests-added, commands-run, validation-output, residual-risks, no-staged-files

Review gate: required by reviewer.

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
