# Task for researcher

Retry 2/3: produce missing Role A history/primary-source report for preset 08 Suspension Garland. Exact inputs: `.planning/phases/10.2-arrangement-presets/10.2-PRESET-CATALOG.md` and `.planning/phases/10.2-arrangement-presets/10.2-RESEARCH-TEMPLATE.md`; do not read siblings. Multiple-reference scope: Fux's 1725 Gradus/species pedagogy and selected Palestrina four-voice source/corpus practice; document their intersection and excluded differences. Cover context, project/career evolution where defensible, persistent vs work-specific traits, peers/shared vocabulary, myths, primary evidence, citations/page/measure references, retrieval date, confidence, disagreements, and gaps. Judge what prepared suspensions across strong beats honestly means. No copied melody. Do not modify project/source files; write `/tmp/contrapunk-suspension-garland-history.md`, skip blocked sources, record gaps, finish.

**Output:**
Write your findings to exactly this path: /tmp/contrapunk-suspension-garland-history.md
This path is authoritative for this run.
Ignore any other output filename or output path mentioned elsewhere, including output destinations in the base agent prompt, system prompt, or task instructions.
