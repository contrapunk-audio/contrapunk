# Task for reviewer

[Read from: /Users/vibhavbobade/go/src/github.com/contrapunk-audio/contrapunk/plan.md, /Users/vibhavbobade/go/src/github.com/contrapunk-audio/contrapunk/progress.md]

Read-only guitar lifecycle/reset audit. Do not edit/stage/run holdout. Trace selection, start/stop/restart, config replacement, panic/cleanup, calibration reload/reset, device loss, queue overflow, and UI store persistence across Tauri and WASM. Focus on what must reset when device/channel/config changes and whether current UI state can lie after errors or restarts. Include the recent intended behavior: device/channel changes while Guitar Audio is live should stop, sync the 0-based backend channel, restart, and display the actual 1-based channel. Report evidence-backed bugs and minimal regression checks.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: reviewed
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Implement the requested change without widening scope
- criterion-2: Return evidence sufficient for an independent acceptance review

Required evidence: changed-files, tests-added, commands-run, validation-output, residual-risks, no-staged-files

Review gate: required by reviewer.

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
