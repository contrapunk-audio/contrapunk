# Task for researcher

You are reviving a previous subagent conversation.

Original run: 5d7c12c8-e4a6-41b8-862f-91dab9e59154
Original agent: researcher
Original session file: /Users/vibhavbobade/.pi/agent/sessions/--Users-vibhavbobade-go-src-github.com-contrapunk-audio-contrapunk--/2026-07-02T16-12-22-502Z_019f239a-4c66-7112-983b-1256bee6eb9f/8830a3e3/run-0/session.jsonl

Use the stored session context as background. Answer the orchestrator's follow-up below. Do not assume the original child process is still alive.

Follow-up:
Use the evidence already collected and write the complete Role C report to `/tmp/contrapunk-stretto-engine-performance.md` now. Do not search further. Record any gaps and finish.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: reviewed
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Implement the requested change without widening scope
- criterion-2: Return evidence sufficient for an independent acceptance review

Required evidence: changed-files, tests-added, commands-run, validation-output, residual-risks, no-staged-files

Review gate: required by reviewer.

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
