# Task for scout

Read-only full feature inventory for a separate functional native Contrapunk UI prototype. Inspect the current Svelte UI, ContrapunkAdapter capability/types, Tauri adapter/backend, and workspace components. Return a concise map of every user-facing production feature grouped into input, performance/harmony, ensemble, visualization, output/routing, transport, presets, diagnostics/settings, plus which existing stores/components can be reused. Identify truthful unsupported surface differences (Tauri/WASM/plugin). Do not modify files.

**Output:**
Write your findings to exactly this path: /Users/vibhavbobade/go/src/github.com/contrapunk-audio/contrapunk/.pi-subagents/artifacts/outputs/3d8fb3bf/context.md
This path is authoritative for this run.
Ignore any other output filename or output path mentioned elsewhere, including output destinations in the base agent prompt, system prompt, or task instructions.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: reviewed
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: changed-files, tests-added, commands-run, validation-output, residual-risks, no-staged-files

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
