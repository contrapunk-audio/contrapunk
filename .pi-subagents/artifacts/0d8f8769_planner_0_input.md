# Task for planner

Plan the smallest production-worthy generic VST3 instrument-hosting slice for Contrapunk, reusing its existing AudioBlock/Chain and CLAP plugin picker/controller patterns. Target: installed Analog Lab V.vst3 on macOS, MIDI note input, stereo audio output, floating editor window, plugin state save/restore if existing CLAP flow has it, and honest capability/UI gating. Instruments only; no audio-input FX, sidechains, automation, or cross-platform packaging beyond code that can compile safely. Inspect repo and current Rust deps plus local Analog Lab V.vst3 bundle. Do not edit. Identify exact files, viable crate/SDK strategy, risks, and staged acceptance checks. Respect realtime no-allocation callback rules.

**Output:**
Write your findings to exactly this path: /Users/vibhavbobade/go/src/github.com/contrapunk-audio/contrapunk/.pi-subagents/artifacts/outputs/0d8f8769/plan.md
This path is authoritative for this run.
Ignore any other output filename or output path mentioned elsewhere, including output destinations in the base agent prompt, system prompt, or task instructions.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
